## What is Vibe Kanban Cloud?

**Vibe Kanban Cloud** adds team collaboration to Vibe Kanban. Your projects, issues, and progress sync to the cloud so your entire team stays in sync.

### Cloud vs Local

| Feature | Local | Cloud |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **Data storage** | On your computer | Synced to cloud |
| **Team access** | Only you | Invite team members |
| **Sign-in required** | No | Yes (GitHub or Google) |
| **Real-time collaboration** | No | Yes |
| **Works offline** | Yes | Requires internet |

<Info>
You can use both Local and Cloud projects in the same Vibe Kanban installation. They appear in separate sections of the sidebar.

## How It Works

1. **Run Vibe Kanban** as usual with `npx vibe-kanban`
2. **Sign in** with your GitHub or Google account (a personal organisation is created automatically)
3. **Create projects** in your personal workspace
4. **Create a team organisation** if you want to collaborate (optional)
5. **Invite team members** via email and collaborate in real-time

Your local projects remain untouched. Cloud projects are stored separately and sync automatically.

## Key Concepts

### Organisations

An **organisation** is your team's shared space. It contains:
- Team members with different roles (Admin, Member)
- Projects that everyone can access
- Shared settings

Think of it as your company or team in Vibe Kanban.

### Projects

A **project** is a kanban board for a specific initiative. Each project has:
- Customisable status columns
- Issues to track work
- Tags for categorisation

### Issues

An **issue** is a single piece of work. Unlike local tasks, Cloud issues have:
- Simple IDs (like `TASK-123`) for easy reference
- Multiple assignees
- Priority levels
- Comments for discussion
- Sub-issues for breaking down work

## Features

### Team Collaboration
- Invite members via email
- Role-based permissions (Admin and Member)
- See who's assigned to what

### Real-Time Sync
- Changes appear instantly for everyone
- No conflicts or manual merging
- Always up to date

### Advanced Kanban
- Drag-and-drop issues between columns
- Custom status columns with colours
- Filter by priority, assignee, or tags
- Multiple sort options

### GitHub Integration
- Link pull requests to issues
- Review code directly in Vibe Kanban
- Track PR status
