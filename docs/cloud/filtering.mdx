---

As your project grows, you'll need ways to find specific issues quickly. The filter bar provides powerful search, filtering, and sorting capabilities to help you focus on what matters.


## The Filter Bar

The filter bar sits above your kanban board and contains:

- **Search field** - Find issues by text
- **Filter dropdowns** - Filter by priority, assignee, tags
- **Sort dropdown** - Change how issues are ordered
- **Clear All button** - Reset all filters

## Searching

Type in the search field to find issues by title.


### How Search Works

- Search matches against issue **titles only**
- Search is **case-insensitive** ("Login" matches "login")
- Search finds **partial matches** ("log" matches "Login flow")
- Results update as you type

### Tips for Effective Search

- Search for keywords in titles
- Use the Simple ID to find a specific issue (e.g., "TASK-123")
- Combine search with filters for precise results

<Tip>
If you can't find an issue, check that your filters aren't hiding it. Click **Clear All** to reset filters and search again.
</Tip>

## Filtering

Filters let you show only issues that match certain criteria.

### Priority Filter

Filter issues by priority level:

<Frame>
  <img style={{maxHeight: "350px"}} src="/images/cloud/filter-priority.png" alt="Priority filter dropdown showing Urgent, High, Medium, and Low options" />
</Frame>

| Priority | Colour | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **Urgent** | Red | Needs immediate attention |
| **High** | Orange | Important, do soon |
| **Medium** | Yellow | Normal priority |
| **Low** | Grey | Can wait |

**To filter by priority:**
1. Click the **Priority** dropdown
2. Select one or more priority levels
3. Only matching issues are shown

### Assignee Filter

Filter issues by who's assigned:

<Frame>
  <img style={{maxHeight: "350px"}} src="/images/cloud/filter-assignee.png" alt="Assignee filter dropdown showing team members" />
</Frame>

**Options:**
- **Specific team members** - Show issues assigned to selected people
- **Unassigned** - Show issues with no assignee

**To filter by assignee:**
1. Click the **Assignee** dropdown
2. Select one or more team members, or "Unassigned"
3. Only matching issues are shown

<Info>
If you select multiple assignees, issues assigned to **any** of them will show (OR logic). An issue assigned to both Alice and Bob shows when filtering for either.
</Info>

### Tags Filter

Filter issues by tags:

<Frame>
  <img style={{maxHeight: "350px"}} src="/images/cloud/filter-tags.png" alt="Tags filter dropdown showing available tags" />
</Frame>

**To filter by tags:**
1. Click the **Tags** dropdown
2. Select one or more tags
3. Only issues with at least one selected tag are shown

### Combining Filters

You can use multiple filters at once. When you do:

- Filters within the same category use **OR** logic
  - Priority: Urgent OR High → shows both
- Filters across categories use **AND** logic
  - Priority: Urgent AND Assignee: Alice → shows urgent issues assigned to Alice

**Example:** To find high-priority bugs assigned to you:
1. Set Priority to "High" and "Urgent"
2. Set Assignee to yourself
3. Set Tags to "Bug"

## Sorting

Control the order of issues within each column.

<Frame>
  <img style={{maxHeight: "350px"}} src="/images/cloud/sort-dropdown.png" alt="Sort dropdown showing Manual, Priority, Created, Updated, and Title options" />
</Frame>

### Sort Options

| Sort By | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Manual** | Your custom order (drag to reorder) |
| **Priority** | Urgent first, then High, Medium, Low |
| **Created** | Newest or oldest first |
| **Updated** | Recently changed first |
| **Title** | Alphabetical order |

### Sort Direction

Click the sort direction button to toggle between:
- **Ascending** (↑) - A→Z, oldest first, low→urgent
- **Descending** (↓) - Z→A, newest first, urgent→low

### Manual Sort Mode

When sort is set to **Manual**:
- You can drag issues to reorder them within columns
- Your custom order is saved and shared with the team
- This is the default mode for most workflows

<Warning>
If you switch away from Manual sort, you **cannot** drag to reorder issues. The order is determined by the selected sort field.
</Warning>

## Clearing Filters

### Clear All

Click the **Clear All** button to reset all filters and search at once. This shows all issues in the project.


### Clear Individual Filters

To clear a single filter:
1. Click the filter dropdown
2. Deselect all options

To clear the search field, click the **×** button inside the search box.

## Filter Persistence

Your filter and sort settings are saved for your session:
- Filters persist when you navigate away and return
- Filters reset when you switch projects
- Filters reset when you sign out

<Info>
Filters are personal - they don't affect what other team members see. Everyone can have their own filter settings.
</Info>
