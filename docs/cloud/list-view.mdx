description: "View and manage all your issues in a tabular format"
---

The list view provides a tabular way to see all your issues, including those in hidden statuses. It's ideal for reviewing many issues at once and getting a complete overview of your project.

## Accessing List View

To switch to list view, click the **All** tab in the header above the board.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/cloud/status-tabs.png" alt="Status tabs showing Active, All, Backlog, and Cancelled" />
</Frame>

| Tab | What it shows |
|-----|---------------|
| **All** | All issues across all statuses (including hidden) |
| **Backlog**, **Cancelled**, etc. | Issues in that specific hidden status only |

To return to the kanban view, click the **Active** tab.

## List Layout

Issues in the list view are grouped by status. Each status section shows:

- **Status name** with colour indicator
- **Issue count** for that status
- **Collapsible sections** - click to expand or collapse

### Issue Row Details

Each row in the list shows:

- **Simple ID** - The issue identifier (e.g., ISS-1)
- **Title** - The issue title
- **Workspace indicator** - Shows if the issue has linked workspaces
- **Age** - How long ago the issue was created (e.g., "12d" for 12 days)

Click any row to open the full [issue panel](/cloud/issues).

## When to Use List View

List view is best for:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Reviewing all issues" icon="list">
  See every issue in your project at once, including hidden statuses like Backlog and Cancelled.
</Card>

<Card title="Finding specific issues" icon="magnifying-glass">
  Combined with search and filters, quickly locate issues across all statuses.
</Card>

<Card title="Bulk review" icon="clipboard-list">
  Scan through many issues quickly without the visual overhead of columns.
</Card>

<Card title="Accessing hidden statuses" icon="eye">
  View and manage issues in Backlog, Cancelled, or other hidden statuses.
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Filtering and Sorting

The filter bar works the same in list view as in kanban view:

- **Search** - Find issues by title
- **Priority** - Filter by priority level
- **Assignee** - Filter by team member
- **Tags** - Filter by tags
- **Sort** - Change the order of issues

See [Filtering & Sorting](/cloud/filtering) for more details.
