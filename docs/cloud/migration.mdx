If you've been using Vibe Kanban locally, you can migrate your existing projects to Cloud to unlock team collaboration, real-time sync, and access from any device.

## Why Migrate?

Moving your projects to Cloud gives you:

</CardGroup>

## Before You Start

Before migrating, make sure you have:

1. **A Cloud account** - Sign in with GitHub or Google (a personal organisation is created automatically)
2. **Local projects** - Projects stored on your machine that you want to migrate

<Info>
Migration copies your data to Cloud - your local projects remain unchanged. You can continue using them locally if needed.
</Info>

## Starting the Migration

### From the Project Banner

When viewing a local project that hasn't been migrated, you'll see a banner prompting you to migrate:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/cloud/migration-prompt-banner.png" alt="Migrate this project to the cloud banner with Learn more button" />
</Frame>

Click **Learn more** to open the migration wizard.

## Migration Steps

The migration wizard guides you through four steps:

### Step 1: Introduction

The first screen explains what Cloud offers and what will happen during migration.

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/cloud/migration-introduction.png" alt="Migration introduction screen showing Cloud benefits" />
</Frame>

- If you're **not signed in**, click **Sign In** to authenticate with GitHub or Google
- If you're **already signed in**, click **Continue** to proceed

When you click Sign In, you'll see the authentication dialog:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/cloud/sign-in-dialog.png" alt="Sign in dialog with GitHub and Google options" />
</Frame>

### Step 2: Choose Projects

Select which local projects you want to migrate:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/cloud/migration-choose-projects.png" alt="Choose projects screen showing project list and organisation selector" />
</Frame>

<Steps>
<Step title="Review your projects">
  You'll see a list of all your local projects with their names and IDs.
</Step>

<Step title="Select projects to migrate">
  Click the checkbox next to each project you want to migrate. Use **Select All** to choose everything at once.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/cloud/migration-project-selected.png" alt="Project selected for migration with Migrate button" />
  </Frame>

  Projects you've already migrated are shown separately with a **View** link to open them in Cloud.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose target organisation">
  If you have multiple organisations, select which one should receive the migrated projects.
</Step>

<Step title="Continue">
  Click **Continue** to proceed to the migration step.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
You can migrate projects in batches. If you have many projects, consider migrating a few first to verify everything works as expected.
</Tip>

### Step 3: Migrate

This step performs the actual migration:

1. Click **Start Migration** to begin
2. Wait while your data is transferred to Cloud
3. You'll see a summary report when complete

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/cloud/migration-complete.png" alt="Migration summary showing projects and tasks migrated" />
</Frame>

| Item | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Projects** | How many projects were migrated vs. total |
| **Tasks** | How many issues/tasks were migrated |
| **PR Merges** | How many pull request links were migrated |
| **Warnings** | Any issues encountered during migration |

<Warning>
Don't close the browser or navigate away while migration is in progress. This could result in incomplete data transfer.
</Warning>

Click **Continue** to proceed to the finish screen.

### Step 4: Finish

The finish screen shows your migrated projects with quick access links:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/cloud/migration-finish.png" alt="Finish screen showing migrated projects with View links" />
</Frame>

- Click **View** next to any project to open it in Cloud
- Click **Migrate More Projects** to migrate additional projects

## What Gets Migrated

The migration transfers the following data:

### Projects
- Project name
- Project colour
- All project settings

### Issues (Tasks)
- Issue titles and descriptions
- Status (which column they're in)
- Any existing metadata

### Pull Request Links
- Connections between issues and GitHub PRs
- PR status information

## What Doesn't Get Migrated

Some data is created fresh in Cloud:

- **Team members** - You'll need to invite teammates after migration
- **Comments** - Local projects don't have comments, so there's nothing to migrate
- **Tags** - You'll set these up in your Cloud project
- **Priorities** - Issues will need priorities assigned after migration

## After Migration

When you return to your local project, you'll see a banner indicating it's been migrated to Cloud:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/cloud/migration-banner.png" alt="Project migrated to Cloud banner with View project button" />
</Frame>

Click **View project** to open the Cloud version with all collaboration features.

Once your projects are in Cloud:

### Invite Your Team

1. Go to your [organisation settings](/cloud/organizations)
2. [Invite team members](/cloud/team-members) via email
3. They'll receive an invitation to join

### Set Up Your Board

1. Open a migrated project
2. [Add tags](/cloud/customisation) for categorisation
3. [Set priorities](/cloud/issues) on important issues
4. [Customise columns](/cloud/customisation) if needed

### Connect GitHub (Optional)

If you want PR tracking:

1. Go to organisation settings
2. [Install the GitHub App](/cloud/github-integration)
3. Enable code review for your repositories

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Migration failed with an error">
Check your internet connection and try again. If the problem persists:

1. Refresh the page
2. Sign out and sign back in
3. Try migrating fewer projects at once

If you continue to have issues, check the error message for specific details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Some projects weren't migrated">
The migration report shows how many projects were skipped. Common reasons:

- **Duplicate names** - A project with the same name already exists in the target organisation
- **Invalid data** - The project has corrupted or incomplete data

Try renaming the local project and migrating again.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tasks are missing after migration">
Check the following:

1. **Filters** - Make sure you don't have active filters hiding issues
2. **Columns** - Check if issues are in a hidden status column
3. **Migration report** - Review the report to see if tasks were skipped

If tasks were skipped, there may have been data issues. Check the warnings in the migration report.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="I want to migrate to a different organisation">
You can run the migration wizard again and select a different target organisation. Note that this will create duplicate projects if you migrate the same projects twice.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I undo the migration?">
Migration copies data to Cloud - it doesn't delete your local projects. Your local data remains unchanged, so there's nothing to "undo".

If you want to remove migrated projects from Cloud, you can delete them from the Cloud project list.
</Accordion>
