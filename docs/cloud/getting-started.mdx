Vibe Kanban Cloud lets you collaborate with your team in real-time. Your data syncs to the cloud, so everyone sees the same projects, issues, and updates.

<Info>
**Already using Vibe Kanban locally?** Cloud uses the same interface you're familiar with. The difference is your data syncs to the cloud and you can invite team members.
</Info>

## Step 1: Launch Vibe Kanban

If you haven't already, start Vibe Kanban:

```bash
npx vibe-kanban
```

The application opens in your browser at `http://localhost:...`.

## Step 2: Sign In

To access Cloud features, you need to sign in.

<Steps>
<Step title="Click Login">
  Click the **Login** button in the sidebar or when prompted.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose a sign-in method">
  Select how you want to sign in:
  - **Sign in with GitHub** - Use your GitHub account
  - **Sign in with Google** - Use your Google account

  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Authorise the application">
  You'll be redirected to GitHub or Google. Sign in if needed, then click **Authorize** or **Allow** to grant Vibe Kanban access.

  <Info>
  Vibe Kanban only requests access to your basic profile (name, email, avatar). It cannot access your private repositories or post on your behalf.
  </Info>
</Step>

<Step title="Return to Vibe Kanban">
  After authorising, you're automatically redirected back and signed in.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Your Personal Organisation

When you sign in for the first time, a **personal organisation** is automatically created for you, along with an **Initial Project** to get you started. This is your private workspace.

<Info>
Personal organisations are just for you - you cannot invite other members. To collaborate with a team, create a new organisation (see Step 5).
</Info>

## Step 4: Create Your First Project

Now create a project to organise your work.

<Steps>
<Step title="Click New Project">
  Click the **+ New Project** button in the sidebar.
</Step>

<Step title="Enter project details">
  - **Name** - What you're working on (e.g., "Mobile App", "Website Redesign")
  - **Colour** - Pick a colour to identify the project

  <Frame>
    <img style={{maxHeight: "300px"}} src="/images/cloud/create-project-dialog.png" alt="Create Project dialog with name and colour fields" />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Click Create">
  Your project is created with a kanban board ready to use.

</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Create a Team Organisation (Optional)

To collaborate with others, create a new organisation and invite team members.

  Click **+ Create organization** and enter your team or company name.

  <Frame>
    <img style={{maxHeight: "300px"}} src="/images/cloud/create-organization-dialog.png" alt="Create Organization dialog" />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Invite team members">
  Open Organisation Settings (click the gear icon next to your org name), then:
  - Click **Invite Member**
  - Enter your teammate's email address
  - Select their role (**Member** or **Admin**)
  - Click **Send Invitation**

  <Frame>
    <img style={{maxHeight: "300px"}} src="/images/cloud/invite-member-dialog.png" alt="Invite Member dialog" />

They'll receive an email with a link to join your organisation.

## You're Ready!

- ✅ A project with a kanban board

**Next steps:**
- [Create issues](/cloud/issues) to track your work
- [Learn the kanban board](/cloud/kanban-board) to manage tasks
- [Customise your board](/cloud/customisation) with columns and tags
- [Invite more team members](/cloud/team-members) to collaborate

## Signing Out

To sign out:

</Frame>

Your data remains safe in the cloud. Sign in again anytime to continue where you left off.

## Switching Between Local and Cloud

You can use both local projects and Cloud projects:

| Local Projects | Cloud Projects |
|----------------|----------------|
| Data stored on your machine | Data synced to cloud |
| Only you can access | Team members can collaborate |
| No sign-in required | Requires sign-in |
| Works offline | Requires internet connection |

Both appear in the same Vibe Kanban interface. Local projects show in one section, Cloud projects in another.
