Projects are where your work lives. Each project contains a kanban board with issues, statuses, and tags that help you organise and track progress.

## What is a Project?

A **project** is a container for related work within your organisation. Think of it as a dedicated space for a specific initiative, product, or team goal.

Each project has:
- **Issues** - Individual work items (bugs, features, tasks)
- **Statuses** - Columns on your kanban board (To Do, In Progress, Done, etc.)
- **Tags** - Labels for categorising issues
- **Team access** - All organisation members can view and work on project issues

## Project Sidebar

The left sidebar provides quick access to your projects and workspaces.

<Frame>

</Frame>

### Sidebar Elements

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Workspaces icon** | Top icon - opens the Workspaces view for coding agents |
| **Project icons** | Square buttons showing project abbreviations (e.g., "VI" for vibe-kanban) |
| **+ button** | Create a new project |

### Project Icons

Each project appears as a square button with a two-letter abbreviation of the project name. The currently selected project is highlighted.

## Default Statuses

New projects come with six default status columns:

| Status | Purpose | Visible by Default |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| **Backlog** | Ideas and future work | Hidden |
| **To do** | Issues ready to start | ✓ |
| **In progress** | Issues currently being worked on | ✓ |
| **In review** | Waiting for code review | ✓ |
| **Done** | Completed issues | ✓ |
| **Cancelled** | Issues that won't be done | Hidden |

<Info>
Hidden statuses don't appear as columns on the board, but you can still access issues in them via the status tabs (e.g., "Backlog" or "Cancelled" tabs).
</Info>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="One project per initiative" icon="folder">
  Create separate projects for distinct initiatives rather than putting everything in one project. This keeps your boards focused and manageable.
</Card>

<Card title="Use descriptive names" icon="tag">
  Choose project names that clearly describe what the project is about. "Mobile App v2" is better than "Project A".
</Card>

<Card title="Consistent status columns" icon="columns">
  Try to use similar status columns across projects so team members can switch between projects without confusion.
</Card>

<Card title="Archive completed work" icon="box-archive">
  Once issues are done, you can hide the Done column or create an Archive status to keep your board clean.
</Card>
</CardGroup>
