Organisations are the top-level container in Vibe Kanban Cloud. They group your team members and projects together.

## What is an Organisation?

An **organisation** represents your team, company, or group. It contains:

- **Projects** - Your kanban boards for managing tasks
- **Members** - People who can access the organisation
- **Settings** - Configuration that applies to all projects


### Organisation Structure

An organisation acts as a container that holds two main things:

**Members** are the people who belong to your organisation. Each member has a role:
- **Admins** have full control - they can invite/remove members, change settings, and delete the organisation
- **Members** can work on all projects but cannot manage organisation settings

**Projects** are your kanban boards. Each project contains tasks, statuses, and tags. All members of an organisation can see and work on all projects within it.

<Tip>
Think of an organisation like a company: the company has employees (members) and departments or initiatives (projects). Everyone in the company can see what each department is working on.
</Tip>

## Personal Organisation

When you sign in for the first time, a **personal organisation** is automatically created for you, along with an **Initial Project**. This is your private workspace.

Personal organisations:
- Are created automatically on first sign-in
- Come with an "Initial Project" ready to use
- Cannot have additional members invited
- Cannot be deleted
- Are only accessible by you

<Info>
To collaborate with others, you need to create a new (non-personal) organisation.
</Info>

## Creating a Team Organisation

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the user menu">
  Click your **profile icon** in the bottom of the left sidebar.

  - **Organization Name** - Your team or company name (e.g., "Acme Corporation")
  - **Slug** - URL-friendly identifier, auto-generated from the name (lowercase, numbers, hyphens only)

  Click **Create Organization** to finish. An **Initial Project** is automatically created in your new organisation.

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="One org per team/company" icon="building">
  Create one organisation for your team or company. Don't create separate orgs for each project.
</Card>

<Card title="Use descriptive names" icon="tag">
  Choose organisation names that clearly identify the team. "Engineering" is better than "Org 1".
</Card>

<Card title="Have multiple admins" icon="users">
  Ensure at least two people are admins in case one leaves or is unavailable.
</Card>

<Card title="Regular member audits" icon="clipboard-check">
  Periodically review who has access and remove members who no longer need it.
</Card>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Can't create an organisation">
**Problem:** The create organisation button doesn't appear or doesn't work.

**Possible causes:**
- You're already in the organisation creation flow
- Network connectivity issues

**Solution:**
Refresh the page and try again. If the issue persists, check your browser's console for errors.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can't see an organisation I should have access to">
**Problem:** An organisation you were invited to doesn't appear in your list.

**Possible causes:**
- The invitation is still pending (check your email)
- You signed in with a different account
- You were removed from the organisation

**Solution:**
1. Check your email for an invitation link
2. Verify you're signed in with the correct account
3. Ask an admin of the organisation to check your membership
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can't leave the organisation">
**Problem:** The "Leave Organisation" button is disabled.

**Cause:** You're the only admin.
