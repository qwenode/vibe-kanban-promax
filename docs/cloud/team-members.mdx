If you need to transfer full ownership of an organisation (e.g., you're leaving the company):

<Steps>
<Step title="Promote the new owner to Admin">
  Ensure the person taking over has the Admin role.
</Step>

<Step title="(Optional) Demote yourself">
  If you're staying as a regular member, another admin can demote you.
</Step>

<Step title="Leave the organisation">
  If you're leaving entirely, you can now leave the organisation from settings.
</Step>
</Steps>
