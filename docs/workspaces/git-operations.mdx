Workspaces provide integrated git operations for managing your code changes.

## Git Basics for Workspaces

If you're not familiar with git, here's what you need to know:

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What is a branch?">
A **branch** is a separate line of development. Think of it as a copy of your code where you can make changes without affecting the original.

In Workspaces:
- **Target branch** (e.g., `main`) - The "original" you'll eventually merge back into
- **Working branch** (e.g., `vk/abc123-task`) - Your copy where changes happen
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is a commit?">
A **commit** is a saved snapshot of your changes. It's like a save point in a video game - you can always go back to it.

In Workspaces, commits happen automatically as the agent works, or you can commit manually through the terminal.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is a pull request (PR)?">
A **pull request** is a request to merge your changes from your working branch into the target branch. It:
- Shows all your changes in one place
- Lets teammates review your code
- Runs automated tests (CI)
- Provides a history of what was changed and why
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is rebasing?">
**Rebasing** updates your working branch with the latest changes from the target branch. It's like saying "pretend I started my work from the current state of main, not the old state."

**When to rebase:**
- Before creating a PR (to avoid conflicts)
- When the target branch has new commits
- When prompted by Vibe Kanban
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What is merging?">
**Merging** combines your changes with the target branch. In Workspaces, this typically happens through a PR on GitHub after code review.

The "Merge" action in Workspaces pulls the target branch INTO your working branch (the opposite direction of a PR merge).
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Repository Status

The Git section in the right sidebar shows:

| Information | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Repository name** | Current repository with status |
| **Current branch** | Your working branch |
| **Target branch** | Branch you'll merge into |
| **Uncommitted changes** | Number of modified files |
| **Ahead/Behind** | Commits relative to target branch |
| **Conflict indicator** | Shows when merge conflicts exist |

## Creating Pull Requests

<Frame>

</Frame>

Create PRs directly from your workspace.

### Creating a PR

**From the Git panel:**
1. Click **Open pull request** in the Git section of the right sidebar
2. Fill in the PR details

**From the command bar:**
1. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K`
2. Select **Create Pull Request**

**PR details:**
   - **Auto-generate PR description with AI** - Let AI write the description based on your changes
   - **Title** - PR title (auto-filled from task name)
   - **Description** - Optional details about the changes
   - **Base Branch** - The branch to merge into
   - **Create as draft** - Mark as draft PR
4. Click **Create PR**

Once created, your PR appears on GitHub with your commits, description, and CI checks running.

<Frame>

</Frame>

### Draft PRs

Enable **Draft** mode when:

- Work is still in progress
- You want early feedback before completion
- CI checks should run but reviewers shouldn't merge yet

### Multi-Repo PRs

For workspaces with multiple repositories:

- Create PRs for each repo separately
- Use the Repo Actions in the command bar
- Reference related PRs in descriptions

<Tip>
Create PRs early to get CI feedback and enable team visibility into your progress.
</Tip>

## Merging Changes

Pull the latest changes from the target branch into your working branch.

### Merge Process

**From the Git panel:**
1. Click the dropdown arrow next to **Open pull request**
2. Select **Merge**

**From the command bar:**
1. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K` and select **Merge**

Target branch changes are merged into your working branch after confirmation.

### Before Merging

The workspace checks if you're behind the target branch:

- **Up to date**: Merge proceeds normally
- **Behind target**: You'll be prompted to rebase first

<Warning>
Always ensure CI checks pass and code reviews are complete before merging.
</Warning>

## Rebasing

Keep your branch up to date with the target branch.

### Rebase Process

**From the Git panel:**
1. Click the target branch dropdown (e.g., **main**)
2. Select **Rebase** from the menu

**From the command bar:**
1. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K` and select **Rebase**

Your commits are replayed on top of the target branch after confirmation.

### Handling Conflicts

<Frame>
<img style={{maxHeight: "300px"}} src="/images/workspaces-conflict-dialog.png" alt="Conflict resolution dialog showing list of conflicting files with resolve and abort options" />
</Frame>

If conflicts occur during rebase:

1. The workspace shows a conflict resolution dialog
2. List of conflicting files is displayed
3. Resolve conflicts in your editor
4. Mark files as resolved
5. Continue or abort the rebase

### When to Rebase

- Before creating a pull request
- When the target branch has new commits
- Before merging to ensure a clean history
- When prompted due to being behind target

## Changing Target Branch

Switch the branch you're merging into.

### Changing the Target

**From the Git panel:**
1. Click the target branch dropdown (e.g., **main**) in the Git section
2. Select a new target branch from the list

**From the command bar:**
1. Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K` and select **Change Target Branch**
2. Choose the new target branch

The workspace updates to show the new ahead/behind status.

### Use Cases

- Switch from `develop` to `main` for release
- Target a feature branch instead of main
- Correct an incorrectly set target

## Pushing Changes

Push your commits to the remote repository.

### When Push is Available

The Push command appears when:

- You have unpushed commits
- A pull request is open for the branch

### Pushing

**From the Git panel:**
- Click the **Push** button when it appears (shows when you have unpushed commits)

**From the command bar:**
- Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K` and select **Push**

Commits are pushed to the remote repository.

<Info>
Push is contextual - it only appears when there are changes to push and a PR exists.
</Info>

## Multi-Repository Git Operations

For workspaces with multiple repositories, manage each repo independently.

### Per-Repository Actions

Access via command bar's **Repo Actions** page:

| Action | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Create PR | Create PR for specific repository |
| Merge | Merge specific repository only |
| Rebase | Rebase specific repository |
| Change Target | Change target for specific repo |

### Coordinating Changes

When working across repos:

1. Make related changes in each repository
2. Create linked PRs referencing each other
3. Merge in the correct order based on dependencies
4. Verify integration after merging

## Conflict Resolution

When git conflicts occur:

### Conflict Dialog

The workspace displays a conflict resolution dialog showing:

- List of conflicting files
- Options to resolve or abort

### Resolution Steps

1. Open conflicting files in your editor
2. Resolve the conflicts manually
3. Save the resolved files
4. Return to the workspace
5. Continue the operation

### Aborting

If you can't resolve conflicts:

- Click **Abort** in the conflict dialog
- The operation is cancelled
- Your branch returns to its previous state

<Warning>
Unresolved conflicts block git operations. Always resolve or abort before continuing work.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Branch Hygiene

- Rebase regularly to stay current with target
- Create PRs early for visibility
- Use descriptive branch names
- Delete merged branches

### PR Workflow

1. Complete your changes
2. Review diffs in the changes panel
3. Rebase if behind target
4. Create a PR (draft if work continues)
5. Address review feedback
6. Merge when approved

### Multi-Repo Coordination

- Plan cross-repo changes upfront
- Document dependencies between PRs
- Merge in dependency order
- Test integration thoroughly

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="'You have uncommitted changes' error">
**What it means:** You have modified files that haven't been committed.

**Solutions:**
1. Let the agent finish its current work (it may be about to commit)
2. Check the Changes panel to see what's modified
3. Commit the changes using the terminal: `git add . && git commit -m "WIP"`
4. Or stash them: `git stash`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="'Branch is behind target' warning">
**What it means:** The target branch (e.g., `main`) has new commits that your working branch doesn't have.

**Solution:** Rebase your branch to include the new changes:
1. Open command bar (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`)
2. Select **Rebase**
3. Resolve any conflicts if prompted
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Merge conflicts during rebase">
**What it means:** Your changes and the target branch's changes modify the same lines of code.

**Solutions:**
1. Vibe Kanban shows a conflict dialog listing affected files
2. Open each conflicting file in your editor
3. Look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
4. Choose which version to keep (or combine them)
5. Save the file and mark it as resolved
6. Continue the rebase

<Tip>
For complex conflicts, you can ask the agent to help resolve them. Start a new message describing the conflict.
</Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="PR creation fails">
**Possible causes:**
- Not authenticated with GitHub
- No changes to create a PR from
- Branch doesn't exist on remote

**Solutions:**
1. Check GitHub integration in Settings → Integrations
2. Ensure you have committed changes
3. Try pushing the branch first using the terminal
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can't push to remote">
**Possible causes:**
- No remote configured
- Authentication issues
- Remote branch is protected

**Solutions:**
1. Verify remote is configured: `git remote -v` in terminal
2. Check GitHub authentication in Settings
3. For protected branches, create a PR instead of pushing directly
</Accordion>
