The preview browser lets you test your application without leaving the workspace.

## Configuring Dev Server Scripts

Before using the preview, you need to configure a dev server script. There are two ways to do this.

### Quick Setup from Preview Panel

If no dev server script is configured, the preview panel shows a setup prompt:

<Frame>
<img style={{maxHeight: "250px"}} src="/images/workspaces-preview-no-script.png" alt="Preview panel showing prompt to set up dev server script with Edit Dev Server Script button" />
</Frame>

1. Click **Edit Dev Server Script**
2. Enter your dev server command (e.g., `npm run dev`)
3. Click **Save** or **Save and Test** to verify it works

<Frame>
<img style={{maxHeight: "300px"}} src="/images/workspaces-fix-dev-script.png" alt="Fix Dev Server Script dialog with script input field and Save and Test button" />
</Frame>

The **Save and Test** button saves your script and immediately starts the dev server so you can verify the configuration works.

### From Repository Settings

Alternatively, configure scripts through the settings:

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Settings">
  Open the command bar (`Cmd/Ctrl + K`) and select **Settings**, or click the settings icon (<Icon icon="gear" />) in the navbar.
</Step>

<Step title="Go to Repository Settings">
  Select the **Repos** tab to view repository-specific settings.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Your Repository">
  Choose the repository you want to configure from the dropdown.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Dev Server Script">
  Enter your dev server command in the **Dev Server Script** field:

  | Framework | Command |
  |-----------|---------|
  | Vite | `npm run dev` |
  | Next.js | `npm run dev` |
  | Create React App | `npm start` |
  | Yarn projects | `yarn dev` |
  | PNPM projects | `pnpm dev` |

  You can also configure:
  - **Setup Script** - Commands to run before starting (e.g., `npm install`)
  - **Cleanup Script** - Commands to run when workspace closes
</Step>

<Step title="Save Settings">
  Click **Save** to apply your changes.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Ensure your dev server prints the URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`) to stdout for automatic detection.
</Tip>

<Note>
For detailed setup including the Web Companion for component selection, see [Testing Your Application](/core-features/testing-your-application).
</Note>

## Opening the Preview

- Click the **Preview** toggle (<Icon icon="desktop" />) in the navbar
- Click the preview icon in the context bar
- Use the [command bar](/workspaces/command-bar): `Cmd/Ctrl + K` → "Toggle Preview Panel"

The preview panel automatically opens when a dev server starts.

## Starting the Dev Server

**From the context bar:**
- Click the **Play** icon (<Icon icon="play" />) to toggle the dev server

**From the command bar:**
- Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K` → "Toggle Dev Server"

The preview panel opens automatically and your application loads in the built-in browser.

## Device Modes

<Frame>
<img style={{maxHeight: "400px"}} src="/images/workspaces-preview-device-modes.png" alt="Preview panel in mobile device mode showing responsive view of the application" />
</Frame>

Test across different viewport sizes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Desktop** | Full-width browser view |
| **Mobile** | Mobile device dimensions |
| **Custom** | Set specific viewport width and height |

Switch modes using the device selector in the preview toolbar.

## Multiple Dev Servers

For projects with multiple services:

- Each dev server appears as a tab
- Switch between servers to view different parts of your application
- Logs are separated per server

## Viewing Logs

The preview panel includes a log viewer:

- View stdout/stderr from your dev server
- **View Full Logs** button for complete output
- Logs update in real-time
- Filter or search log content

<Tip>
If your preview isn't loading, check the logs for error messages or port conflicts.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

1. Start the dev server early in your task
2. Keep the preview visible while the agent works
3. Test changes incrementally
4. Use device modes to verify responsive design

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Preview shows blank page">
**Possible causes:**
- Dev server hasn't finished starting
- Wrong URL being loaded
- Application has a JavaScript error

**Solutions:**
1. Check the Logs panel for the dev server output - wait for "ready" or similar message
2. Verify the correct URL is detected (shown in the preview address bar)
3. Open browser DevTools (right-click → Inspect) to check for console errors
4. Try refreshing the preview with the reload button
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Preview doesn't update after changes">
**Possible causes:**
- Hot reload isn't working
- Build error preventing update
- Browser caching

**Solutions:**
1. Check Logs panel for build errors
2. Try a hard refresh (Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R)
3. Restart the dev server using the Play button
4. Verify your framework supports hot module replacement (HMR)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="'No dev server script configured' message">
**What to do:**
1. Click **Edit Dev Server Script** in the preview panel
2. Enter your dev server command (see table below)
3. Click **Save and Test**

| Framework | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Vite | `npm run dev` or `pnpm dev` |
| Next.js | `npm run dev` |
| Create React App | `npm start` |
| Vue CLI | `npm run serve` |
| Angular | `ng serve` |
| Django | `python manage.py runserver` |
| Rails | `rails server` |
| Go | `go run main.go` |
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Port conflict error">
**What it means:** Another process is using the same port your dev server wants.

**Solutions:**
1. Find and stop the conflicting process
2. Change your dev server port in your project config
3. Close other workspaces that might have dev servers running
4. Run `lsof -i :3000` (replace 3000 with your port) to find what's using it
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Preview works but assets/images don't load">
**Possible causes:**
- Relative paths not resolving correctly
- Assets served from wrong directory
- CORS issues

**Solutions:**
1. Check that asset paths in your code are correct
2. Verify your dev server is configured to serve static assets
3. Check browser DevTools Network tab for failed requests
