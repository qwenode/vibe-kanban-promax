The changes panel lets you review all code modifications in your workspace and provide feedback to agents.

## Why Review Changes?

Before committing or creating a PR, you should always review what the agent changed:

- **Verify correctness** - Does the code do what you asked?
- **Check for issues** - Are there bugs, security problems, or style violations?
- **Understand the approach** - Learn what the agent did so you can explain it to reviewers
- **Provide feedback** - Ask the agent to fix problems before committing

<Warning>
**Never blindly trust agent output.** Always review changes before merging. Agents can make mistakes, introduce bugs, or misunderstand requirements.
</Warning>

## Opening Changes

- Click the **Changes** toggle (<Icon icon="code-compare" />) in the navbar
- Click the changes icon in the context bar
- Use the command bar: `Cmd/Ctrl + K` → "Toggle Changes Panel"

## File Tree

The changes panel displays a hierarchical file tree:

- **Folders**: Expand/collapse to navigate
- **Files**: Click to view the diff
- **Search**: Filter files by name
- **Expand/Collapse All**: Quick navigation buttons

## Diff Viewer

View code changes with syntax highlighting:

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Additions** | Green highlighting for new lines |
| **Deletions** | Red highlighting for removed lines |
| **Context** | Surrounding unchanged lines for reference |
| **Line numbers** | Original and new line numbers |

## Diff View Modes

Toggle between two display modes:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Unified** | Inline view with changes interleaved |
| **Side-by-Side** | Original and modified shown in parallel columns |

Switch modes using the diff view toggle in the navbar (when Changes panel is open) or via command bar: `Cmd/Ctrl + K` → "Toggle Diff View Mode".

## Diff Options

Customise the diff display:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Wrap Lines** | Enable/disable line wrapping for long lines |
| **Ignore Whitespace** | Show/hide whitespace-only changes |
| **Expand All** | Expand all collapsed diff sections |
| **Collapse All** | Collapse all diff sections |

Access these via the command bar's Diff Options page.

## Giving Feedback with Comments

</Frame>

Add comments directly on code changes to provide feedback to agents.

### Adding Comments

1. Hover over a line in the diff
2. Click the comment icon that appears
3. Write your feedback
4. Submit the comment

### Comment Uses

- **Request changes**: Ask the agent to modify specific code
- **Ask questions**: Get explanations about implementation choices
- **Provide context**: Share additional requirements or constraints
- **Approve sections**: Indicate code that looks good

### Agent Response to Comments

<Frame>

</Frame>

When you send a message with review comments, the agent sees your feedback and acts on it. In this example, the agent restores a file after the user requested the change be reverted.

<Info>
Comments are visible to the agent in subsequent messages, helping guide further development.

## GitHub Integration

When your workspace is linked to a pull request:

### Viewing GitHub Comments

<Frame>

</Frame>

- Click the **GitHub icon** in the changes panel toolbar to toggle GitHub comments
- Comments from the PR appear inline with the diff
- Badge shows comment count per file

<Frame>
<img style={{maxHeight: "300px"}} src="/images/workspaces-github-comments-inline.png" alt="GitHub review comment displayed inline in the diff view" />
</Frame>

<Note>
Only submitted review comments are shown. Pending reviews (not yet submitted on GitHub) won't appear until you submit the review.
</Note>

### Linking to a PR

Workspaces automatically link when:

- You create a PR from the workspace
- The workspace branch matches an existing PR

<Tip>
Review GitHub comments alongside your changes to address PR feedback efficiently.

## Review Workflow

Follow this workflow to effectively review and refine agent changes:

<Steps>
<Step title="Wait for agent to finish">
Let the agent complete its work. The status in the sidebar will change from "Running" to "Idle".
</Step>

<Step title="Open the Changes panel">
Click the Changes icon in the navbar or use `Cmd/Ctrl + K` → "Toggle Changes Panel".
</Step>

<Step title="Review each file">
Click through each modified file in the file tree. Look for:
- **Logic errors** - Does the code do what you intended?
- **Missing pieces** - Are there unhandled edge cases?
- **Code quality** - Is the code readable and maintainable?
- **Security issues** - Any obvious vulnerabilities?
</Step>

<Step title="Add comments on issues">
For any problems you find, hover over the line and click the comment icon. Write specific feedback:

**Good comment:** "This API endpoint should validate the user ID before querying the database to prevent unauthorized access."

**Bad comment:** "This is wrong, fix it."
</Step>

<Step title="Send feedback to agent">
Type a message in the chat (e.g., "Please address the review comments") and send it. The agent will see your inline comments and make corrections.
</Step>

<Step title="Re-review and repeat">
After the agent addresses feedback, review the new changes. Repeat until you're satisfied.
</Step>

<Step title="Create PR when ready">
Once changes look good, create a pull request using the Git panel or command bar.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
**Be specific in comments.** Instead of "this is wrong", explain what's wrong and ideally suggest a fix. The more context you give, the better the agent can correct the issue.
</Tip>
