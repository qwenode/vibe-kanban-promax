The Workspaces UI is a complete redesign of the task execution experience, providing an IDE-like interface optimised for AI-assisted development workflows.

## What is a Workspace?

A **workspace** is an isolated environment for completing a coding task. Think of it as a dedicated "project room" where you:

1. **Work on a specific task** - Each workspace focuses on one goal (e.g., "Add user authentication")
2. **Chat with coding agents** - AI assistants that write and modify code for you
3. **Review changes** - See exactly what code was added, modified, or deleted
4. **Test your application** - Built-in preview browser to see changes in action
5. **Create pull requests** - Submit your changes for review when ready

<Info>
**Why use Workspaces instead of coding manually?**

Workspaces let you describe what you want in plain English, and AI coding agents do the implementation. You review the changes, provide feedback, and iterate until the task is complete. It's like having a junior developer who works instantly and never gets tired.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| **Workspace** | A task execution environment where you work with agents | "Add user authentication" |
| **Repository** | A git repository included in a workspace | `frontend`, `backend` |
| **Session** | A conversation thread with a coding agent | Claude Code session for implementing a feature |

**How they relate:**
- A **workspace** is your working environment for a specific task
- A workspace can contain one or more **repositories** (each with independent git state)
- Within a workspace, you can have multiple **sessions** to chat with different agents or start fresh conversations

For example, you create a workspace for "Add authentication" that includes both `frontend` and `backend` repositories. Within that workspace, you might have one session for implementing the backend API and another session for the frontend UI.

## Key Features

<Card title="Multi-Repository Support" icon="folder-tree" href="/workspaces/multi-repo-sessions">
  Work across multiple repositories within a single workspace. Reference code from one repo while implementing changes in another.
</Card>

<Card title="Multiple Sessions" icon="messages" href="/workspaces/multi-repo-sessions">
  Run multiple agent conversations simultaneously. Work around token limits by starting fresh sessions while keeping context.
</Card>

<Card title="Integrated Preview" icon="browser" href="/workspaces/preview">
  Built-in browser preview without leaving the workspace. Test across desktop, mobile, and custom viewport sizes.
</Card>

<Card title="Changes Panel" icon="code-compare" href="/workspaces/changes">
  Review code modifications with syntax-highlighted diffs. Add inline comments to provide feedback to agents.
</Card>

<Card title="Integrated Terminal" icon="rectangle-terminal" href="/workspaces/interface#terminal-section">
  Built-in terminal for running commands directly in your workspace. New to the Workspaces UI.
</Card>

## Enabling Workspaces

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Settings">
  Click the ⚙️ icon in the sidebar or navigate to **Settings** from the menu.
</Step>

<Step title="Find Beta Features">
  Scroll down to the **Beta Features** section.
</Step>

<Step title="Enable Workspaces">
  Toggle **Enable Workspaces Beta** to enable the new UI.
</Step>

<Step title="Access Workspaces">
  Click on any task attempt to open it in the new Workspaces UI.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Returning to Classic UI

You can return to the classic kanban board interface at any time:

- **From the navbar**: Click the exit icon on the left side of the workspaces navbar
- **From settings**: Disable **Enable Workspaces Beta** in Settings → Beta Features
- **From command bar**: Press `Cmd/Ctrl + K` and select "Open in Old UI"

<Info>
Your workspaces and task data are preserved when switching between the classic and new UI. You can switch back and forth without losing any work.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="What happens to my code when I create a workspace?">
When you create a workspace, Vibe Kanban:

1. Creates a **git worktree** - a separate working directory linked to a new branch
2. Your original repository stays untouched
3. All changes happen in the worktree on a new branch
4. Nothing is pushed to remote until you explicitly create a PR

**Your main branch is safe.** The workspace isolates all changes until you're ready to merge.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I work on multiple tasks at once?">
Yes. Each workspace is completely independent:

- Create as many workspaces as you need
- Each has its own branch, changes, and sessions
- Switch between workspaces using the sidebar
- Agents in different workspaces don't interfere with each other
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if the agent makes a mistake?">
You have full control:

- **Review changes** in the Changes panel before committing
- **Add comments** on specific lines to request fixes
- **Edit messages** to retry with different instructions
- **Start a new session** if the conversation goes off track
- **Delete the workspace** if you want to start completely fresh

The agent only modifies files in your workspace - it cannot push code or merge without your explicit action.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do I know when the agent is done?">
Watch for these indicators:

- **Status in sidebar** changes from "Running" to "Idle"
- **Chat shows completion** message or asks for next steps
- **Changes panel** shows all modifications made

If the agent needs your input (approval, clarification), you'll see a "Needs Attention" indicator with a raised hand icon.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What's the difference between a Project and a Workspace?">
- **Project** = A container that groups related repositories (configured once in Settings)
- **Workspace** = A task execution environment for a specific coding task

Think of it this way: A Project is like a team folder that contains your repos. A Workspace is a task you're working on using those repos.
