Sessions are conversation threads with coding agents within a workspace. Each session maintains its own conversation history, allowing you to work on different aspects of a task or try alternative approaches.

## What is a Session?

A **session** is a single conversation with a coding agent. Think of it like a chat thread:

- **Each session has its own conversation history** - messages, code changes, and context
- **Sessions share the same files** - changes from one session are visible to all sessions
- **Sessions are independent processes** - one can be running while another is idle

<Info>
**Key point:** Sessions share files but not conversation context. If Session 1 makes changes, Session 2 can see those file changes but doesn't know what instructions Session 1 received.
</Info>

## Understanding Token Limits

AI models have a **context window** - a limit on how much text they can "remember" in a conversation. When you hit this limit:

- The agent may forget earlier parts of the conversation
- Responses may become less accurate
- You'll see the context gauge turn orange or red

**Solution:** Start a new session. The new session gets a fresh context window while still having access to all your files.

<Tip>
Watch the **context gauge** in the chat interface. When it shows high usage (orange/red), consider starting a new session.
</Tip>

## When NOT to Create a New Session

- **Continuing related work** - Keep using the same session if the agent needs context from earlier messages
- **Providing feedback** - Use the same session to tell the agent what to fix
- **Small follow-ups** - "Also add a loading spinner" belongs in the current session

<Warning>
New sessions don't inherit conversation history. The new agent won't know what happened in previous sessions unless you explain it again or it reads the file changes.
</Warning>

<Info>
All sessions within a workspace share the same repositories and git state. Changes made by one session are visible to others.
</Info>

## Creating a New Session

<Steps>
<Step title="Open the Session Dropdown">
  Click the session dropdown (showing "Latest" or the session name) in the chat toolbar.
</Step>

<Step title="Click New Session">
  Select **+ New Session** from the dropdown menu.

  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Start Your Conversation">
  The new session opens with a fresh conversation. Describe what you want the agent to work on.

  <Tip>
  Give context about what's already been done in other sessions if relevant. The agent doesn't have access to conversations from other sessions.
  </Tip>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Switching Between Sessions

To switch to a different session:

1. Click the session dropdown in the chat toolbar
2. Select the session you want to switch to

The dropdown shows:
- **Session name** - Based on the initial task or auto-generated
- **Latest** indicator - Shows which session was most recently active

<Note>
Switching sessions doesn't interrupt any running agent processes. Each session's agent continues working independently.
</Note>

## Session States

Sessions can be in different states:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Running** | Agent is actively processing and making changes |
| **Idle** | Waiting for your input |
| **Needs Attention** | Agent is waiting for approval or has a question |

The workspace sidebar shows the overall workspace state based on its sessions.

## Managing Sessions

### Renaming Sessions

Sessions are automatically named based on the initial task description. Currently, session names cannot be manually changed.

### Viewing Session History

Each session maintains its complete conversation history. Scroll up in the conversation panel to view earlier messages and agent actions.

### Stopping an Agent

If an agent is running in the current session:

1. Click the **Stop** button in the navbar, or
2. Use the keyboard shortcut to stop execution

<Warning>
Stopping an agent may leave changes in an incomplete state. Review the changes panel to see what was modified.
</Warning>

## Multiple Agents in Sessions

Different sessions can use different agents:

1. Create a new session
2. Select a different agent from the **Agent** dropdown before sending your message
3. Each session remembers which agent it's using

<Tip>
Use specialised agents for different tasks - for example, one agent for backend work and another for frontend changes.
</Tip>

## Session Best Practices

### When to Create New Sessions

- **Task complexity** - Break complex tasks into smaller sessions
- **Token limits** - Start fresh when conversations get long
- **Different approaches** - Try alternative solutions without losing progress
- **Parallel work** - Have agents work on independent parts simultaneously

### Keeping Sessions Organised

- **One focus per session** - Keep each session focused on a specific goal
- **Use workspace notes** - Document which session is for what purpose
- **Review before switching** - Check the changes panel before switching sessions

## Resolving Conflicts Between Sessions

When multiple sessions make changes to the same files:

1. The changes panel shows all modifications across sessions
2. Review changes carefully before committing
3. Use the inline comment feature to mark areas needing attention

<Note>
Git handles most conflicts automatically. For complex conflicts, see [Resolving Rebase Conflicts](/core-features/resolving-rebase-conflicts).
