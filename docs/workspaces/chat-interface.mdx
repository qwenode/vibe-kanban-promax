</Frame>

The chat interface is your primary way of communicating with coding agents. It supports rich message formatting, file attachments, approval workflows, and multiple conversation sessions.

## Message Types

The chat displays different types of messages, each with distinct styling:

### User Messages

Your messages appear with an edit option. Click the pencil icon to modify and resend a message.

### Agent Messages

Agent responses are rendered with full markdown support, including:
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Tables and lists
- Links and formatted text

### System Messages

Informational messages from the system, such as model initialisation or status updates.

### Error Messages

Error messages appear in red with a warning icon. Click to expand and see full error details.

## Chat Input

### Writing Messages

<Frame>

### Attaching Images

<Frame>
<img style={{maxHeight: "300px"}} src="/images/workspaces-attach-images.png" alt="File picker dialog for attaching images to chat messages" />
</Frame>

You can attach images to your messages:

1. **Click the attachment button** (paperclip icon) in the toolbar
2. **Drag and drop** images directly into the chat
3. Images are uploaded and referenced in your message

<Tip>
Attach screenshots to show the agent exactly what you're working on or what issue you're experiencing.
</Tip>

### File Mentions

<Frame>
<img style={{maxHeight: "300px"}} src="/images/workspaces-file-mentions.png" alt="File mentions typeahead showing matching files when typing @" />
</Frame>

Type `@` to mention files from your repository. The chat provides typeahead suggestions showing:

- **Filename** in bold
- **Full path** below each file
- Matches update as you type

Select a file to include it as context for the agent.

## Sending Messages

### Send Actions

| Action | Shortcut | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| **Send** | `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` | Send message immediately |
| **Queue** | Click Queue button | Queue message while agent is running |
| **Stop** | Click Stop button | Stop the current agent execution |

### Execution States

<Frame>
<img style={{maxHeight: "300px"}} src="/images/workspaces-running-state.png" alt="Chat interface in running state showing Queue and Stop buttons" />
</Frame>

The chat interface shows different states:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Idle** | Ready to send a new message |
| **Running** | Agent is actively working |
| **Queued** | Your message is queued for when agent finishes |
| **Sending** | Message is being sent |

<Info>
When the agent is running, you can queue a follow-up message instead of waiting for it to finish.
</Info>

## Agent Selection

### Choosing an Agent

Select which coding agent to use from the **Agent** dropdown in the chat toolbar. Available agents depend on your configuration.

### Variants

<Frame>
<img style={{maxHeight: "300px"}} src="/images/workspaces-agent-selection.png" alt="Variants dropdown showing Default, Approvals, Opus, and Plan options with Customise button" />
</Frame>

Some agents support different variants or profiles. Use the variant selector to choose:

- Different model configurations
- Custom system prompts
- Specialised behaviours

Click **Customise** to configure agent settings.

## Approval Workflow

Some agents (especially with planning mode enabled) ask for your approval before making changes. This gives you control over what gets implemented.

### Why Approvals Exist

- **Prevent unwanted changes** - Review the plan before code is written
- **Catch misunderstandings early** - Ensure the agent understood your request
- **Guide the approach** - Steer the agent toward your preferred solution

### Reviewing Plans

When the agent needs approval, you'll see an approval card in the chat:

1. **Read the plan summary** - What the agent intends to do
2. **Expand for details** - Click to see the full plan with specific files and changes
3. **Choose an action:**
   - **Approve** - Agent proceeds with the plan
   - **Request Changes** - Provide feedback for revision

### Requesting Changes

If the plan isn't quite right:

1. Type your feedback in the chat input explaining what should be different
2. Click **Request Changes**
3. The agent revises the plan based on your feedback
4. Review the new plan and approve or request more changes

<Tip>
**Be specific in your feedback.** Instead of "that's not right", say "don't modify the database schema - just add the validation to the existing User model."
</Tip>

<Warning>
**Approval timeouts:** If you don't respond to an approval request, it may timeout. You'll need to send a new message to restart the task.
</Warning>

### Disabling Approvals

If you want the agent to work autonomously without asking for approval:
1. Use an agent variant without planning mode
2. Or configure `dangerously_skip_permissions` in agent settings (use with caution)

## Editing Messages

You can edit and resend previous messages:

<Frame>
<img style={{maxHeight: "250px"}} src="/images/workspaces-edit-message-1.png" alt="User message showing edit pencil icon in the top right corner" />
</Frame>

<Steps>
<Step title="Click the Edit Button">
  Click the pencil icon on any of your messages.
</Step>

<Step title="Modify Your Message">
  The message content appears in an editable text area. Make your changes.

  <Frame>
  <img style={{maxHeight: "250px"}} src="/images/workspaces-edit-message-2.png" alt="Edit mode showing message in editable text area with Cancel and Retry buttons" />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Submit the Edit">
  Click **Retry** to resend the modified message. The conversation continues from that point. Click **Cancel** to discard your changes.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Editing a message creates a new branch in the conversation. Subsequent messages after the edited one will be replaced.
</Warning>

## Status Indicators

### Token Usage

<Frame>
<img style={{maxHeight: "200px"}} src="/images/workspaces-token-usage.png" alt="Context gauge showing 13% usage with 27K of 200K tokens used" />
</Frame>

The context gauge shows how much of the agent's context window is used. Understanding this helps you get better results.

#### What are Tokens?

**Tokens** are how AI models measure text. Roughly:
- 1 token ≈ 4 characters or ¾ of a word
- A 200K context window can hold about 150,000 words

The context window includes everything the agent "remembers": your messages, its responses, code it has read, and file contents.

#### Why Token Usage Matters

When usage is high:
- Agent may "forget" earlier parts of the conversation
- Responses may become less accurate
- Agent might re-read files it already read
- Complex reasoning may suffer

#### Usage Levels

| Colour | Usage | What to Do |
|--------|-------|------------|
| Grey | 0-30% | All good, continue working |
| Default | 30-60% | Normal usage, keep going |
| Orange | 60-80% | Consider starting a new session soon |
| Red | 80%+ | Start a new session - agent is near its limit |

<Tip>
**Pro tip:** When starting a new session due to high token usage, briefly summarise what was accomplished. The new agent won't know what happened before.
</Tip>

### Tasks Progress

<Frame>
<img style={{maxHeight: "300px"}} src="/images/workspaces-tasks-panel.png" alt="Tasks panel showing 5/5 completed with progress bar and list of individual tasks" />
</Frame>

When the agent breaks down work into tasks, a progress indicator appears in the chat toolbar:

- **Progress bar** showing completion percentage
- **Task count** (e.g., "5/5 completed")
- **Individual tasks** with checkmarks when complete

Click the indicator to expand the full task list showing each step the agent is working through.

### File Changes

The chat shows file modification summaries:

- **Green** numbers indicate lines added
- **Red** numbers indicate lines removed
- Click to view the file in the Changes panel

## Tool Outputs

### Command Execution

When the agent runs commands, you'll see:

- **Terminal icon** for bash commands
- **Exit code** for completed commands
- **Fix Script** button if a command fails

Click to view full output in the logs panel.

### Search Results

Search operations show summarised results. Click to expand and see full search output.

## Review Comments

When you add inline comments in the Changes panel:

1. A banner appears showing the comment count
2. Comments are automatically included when you send a message
3. Click **Clear** to remove pending comments

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Cmd/Ctrl + Enter` | Send message (or contextual action) |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + B` | Bold text |
| `Cmd/Ctrl + I` | Italic text |
| `Escape` | Cancel current action |
